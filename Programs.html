      	   <h2>Selection Criteria:</h2>
      	   <p>
	   The Selection Committee will choose the recipient of the Rajesh Bhata Memorial 
	   Scholarship Award for academic excellence and extracurricular activities. Appendix B 
	   describes the selection criteria and lists their weighting. Based on the application 
	   the Selection Committee will award points for each of the criteria and choose the 
	   winner scoring the maximum total points. In case of a tie, the judges may divide the 
	   available scholarship funds amongst them. The candidate will be disqualified, if 
	   there is any evidence (including police records) of substance abuse.
	   </p> 
     
      	   <h2> Section Committee:</h2> 
      	   <p> 
	   The Selection Committee will be composed of three individuals, in good standing in 
	   the Coastal Bend Community at large (not belonging to the CBIA committee), selected 
	   by the Scholarship sub-committee. The Selection Committee will appoint its own 
	   designated leader who will report the findings to the Scholarship Sub-Committee.
	   </p> 

      	   <h2> Scholarship Award Amounts</h2> 
      	   <p> 
	   The Scholarship Subcommittee is responsible for raising the required principal amount 
	   for the CBIA Scholarship Fund. The Fund will be invested in an insured money market 
	   or a CB account at a local bank. The scholarship awards will be given out yearly from 
	   the interest/dividends earned from CBIA scholarship Fund in that year. However, a 
	   minimum of $500.00 award is reserved. If there are additional earnings on the 
	   account, the CBIA Scholarship Sub-Committee may recommend more than one scholarship, 
	   specify the amount of scholarship, and advise the Selection Committee to nominate the 
	   candidates accordingly. In case of a shortfall, it is the responsibility of the 
	   Scholarship Sub-Committee to raise the required funds for that year. Principals 
	   raised may not be withdrawn from giving the scholarship except during the first 
	   year.
