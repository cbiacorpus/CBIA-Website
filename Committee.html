    <h3>President</h3>
    <p>Namaste Coastal Bend Indian Community! I am Utpal Bhalala, the President of our esteemed Coastal Bend India Association. I grew up in Bombay (Mumbai), so I am a Mumbaikar, and though I have settled in the USA since 2005, I am pakka Desi at heart.

Medical College (University of Bombay), The Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania), Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Baylor College of Medicine.

As a seasoned Physician Leader, I have led cross-functional teams at a variety of healthcare systems as well as the Society of Critical Care Medicine. In my current role as a Pediatrician at Amistad Health and as a Medical Director at HCA Healthcare, I not only serve as a clinician, taking care of acutely ill children, but also as a healthcare executive. Now, as I continue my journey as a Physician and Physician Leader, I aim to dedicate my healthcare leadership skills to giving people a healthier tomorrow.</p>
